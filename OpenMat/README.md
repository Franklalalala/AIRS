# OpenMat

This is the folder for our research project codes about **AI for material science**. We focus on applying deep learning models to crystal material property prediction and generation tasks. We have included the codes of 
- [Matformer](https://openreview.net/forum?id=pqCT3L-BU9T)
- [PotNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10045)
- [SyMat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02707)
- [ComFormer](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BnQY9XiRAS)
- [GMTNet](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BOFjRnJ9mX)
- [Mat2Seq](https://openreview.net/forum?id=18FGRNd0wZ)

We will add more codes in the future. Stay tuned!
