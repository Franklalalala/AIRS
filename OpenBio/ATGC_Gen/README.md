## Installation

- clone this repo
- create the env and install the requirements
  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/divelab/AIRS.git
cd AIRS/OpenBio/Seq2Exp
source ./install.sh
```

# Dataset

The dataset for this repo can be downloaded from https://huggingface.co/datasets/xingyusu/DNA_Gen. \
Please place the downloaded contents into a newly created folder named `data/`.


# Training and Evaluation

All training and evaluation scripts are located in the `scripts/` directory.

For example, to run the training process of promoter design, execute
```bash
sh scripts/bert_train_promo.sh
```

After training completes, you can perform evaluation with
```bash
sh scripts/bert_gen_promo.sh
```

> **Note:** Please ensure that `ROOT_PATH` and `model_path` are correctly set in the script before running.  
> Other datasets follow similar logic and structure.



# Evaluation by Trained Models

The pretrained models are available at: https://huggingface.co/xingyusu/DNA_ATGC_Gen. \
To use it, set the `model_path` in the corresponding generation script to point to the downloaded `.ckpt` file.
