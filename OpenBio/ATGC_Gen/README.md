## Installation

- clone this repo
- create the env and install the requirements
  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/divelab/AIRS.git
cd AIRS/OpenBio/Seq2Exp
source ./install.sh
```

# Dataset

The dataset for this repo can be downloaded from https://huggingface.co/datasets/xingyusu/DNA_Gen. 

Please place the downloaded contents into a newly created folder named `data/`.


# Training and Evaluation

All the training and evaluation codes are under `scripts/`

For example, users could run the training code
```bash
sh scripts/bert_train_promo.sh
```

After the training, run the evaluation codes
```bash
sh scripts/bert_gen_promo.sh
```
Note to potentially change the ROOT_PATH and the model_path.
Other datasets follow similar logics


# Evaluation by Trained Models

The pretrained model can be downloaded from https://huggingface.co/xingyusu/GeneExp_Seq2Exp. 
Set the model_path of the corresponding generation bash file as the downloaded model path (`.ckpt` file).
