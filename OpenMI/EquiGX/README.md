# On Explaining Equivariant Graph Networks via Improved Relevance Propagation

## Usage  

### Download ckpt and datasets

Using the following command to download ckpt: 

```sh 
wget --no-check-certificate 'https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=12PoiOWYkbiwAUmpSp1TN6m4gZF8YjI3O' -O EquiGX_ckpt.tar.gz
```

Unzip it and put under directory `EquiGX/ckpt/`. 

For BioLip and SCOP dataset, download from [BioLip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12h2XGbZBlFHk9sTyXqib4AKP34E0VBnO/view?usp=drive_link) and [SCOP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CVShQi9hdsSj7CLmxXw7q9eduiQYkJHP/view?usp=drive_link). Unzip them and put under directory `EquiGX/dataset/biolip` and `EquiGX/dataset/scope`.


### Run EquiGX

We provide corresponding notebook to run EquiGX.
